        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. This information is typically known as metadata.</li>
          <li>Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are known as child elements.</li>
          <li>Element and Tag are typically used interchangeably but they are different.</li>
          <li>Element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tags refer to only what is inside the angled brackets.</li>
          <li>'a' element is known as an anchor element and it creates links to other web pages or the same web page.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>CSS provides the visual layout of the web app.</li>
          <li>It is used to style the HTML elements.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element is structured like a box. There are four main parts of the box. They are Margin, Border, Padding, Content.</li>
          <li>A Margin is how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A Padding is the space we want around the Content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A Border seperates the Margin and the Padding.</li>
          <li>CSS Rules are typically formated as follows: "selector {property: value; property: value;}". "property: value" is known as a Declaration. The declarations inside of the { } is refered to as a Declaration block.</li>
          <li>When we want to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page we use (*).</li>
          <li>DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse and share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines of code to write and maintain.</li>
          <li>You must link your CSS style sheet in your HTML file in order to apply the style changes.</li>
          <li>The link element should be placed</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that stores the different versions of your program.</li>
          <li>Git commands in the Command Line Interface always start with "git".</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b "branch-name": creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Git Hub is the cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories (aka repos).</li>
          <li>Repositories (Repos) are used as folders to store files for your project.</li>
          <li>Git Hub is also used to collaborate with other developers.</li>
          <li>Branches are created to work on the project without modifying the live version.</li>
          <li>When you are done modifying the project you can submit a Pull Request to merge the branch you were working on into the main branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The browser reads code from a JavaScript file from the top down.</li>
          <li>Below are some core features of JavaScript:</li>
          <li>  1. Variables: containers that store values.</li>
          <li>  2. Comments: notes/clarification of a section of code for developers to better understand the code running.</li>
          <li>  3. Operators: mathmatical symbols used to produce results of two values or variables.</li>
          <li>  4. Conditionals: code structures that test if a set of requirements are true or false.</li>
          <li>  5. Functions: a way to create reusable block of code that can be reused in the area of control flow that the developer wants.</li>
          <li>  6. Events: code structures that listen for activitey in the browser and run code in response.</li>
          <li>for loops are a good way to reduce the amount of lines of code needed to run a certain task.</li>
          <li>In order to make a Function usable you must call it out in the section of control flow you want the instructions to be ran.</li>
