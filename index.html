          <li>It is used to style the HTML elements.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element is structured like a box. There are four main parts of the box. They are Margin, Border, Padding, Content.</li>
          <li>A Margin is how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A Padding is the space we want around the Content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A Border seperates the Margin and the Padding.</li>
          <li>CSS Rules are typically formated as follows: "selector {property: value; property: value;}". "property: value" is known as a Declaration. The declarations inside of the { } is refered to as a Declaration block.</li>
          <li>When we want to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page we use (*).</li>
