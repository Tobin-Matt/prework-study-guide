# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I am motivated to learn three of the most common programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the most common version control software, Git, to undertand how to create web pages and web applications. 

I wanted to create a study guide for the notes I took during the prework section of the bootcamp about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and have them stored in one central location.

I used the three programming languages and version control of Git to create a web page of my study guide.

While creating this study guide I learned the basics of structuring a web page with HTML, how to style it using CSS, and make it interactive by adding a JavaScript file. Each part of creating the study guide I learned the basics of Git version control to ensure my remote repository and my local repository were up-to-date.
